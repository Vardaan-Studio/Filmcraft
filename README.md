Overview

Mission Vardaan Studio is an exciting project aimed at creating a user-friendly video editing 
application using C++ and the Qt framework. Our goal is to build a powerful yet accessible video 
editor that caters to everyone, from beginners who are just starting to explore video editing to 
experienced professionals looking for advanced features.
Project Goals

User-Friendly Interface: We want to design an intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to 
navigate and access various editing tools without feeling overwhelmed.

Rich Editing Features: The application will include essential features such as:
    
        Media Import: Users can easily import videos and audio files from their devices.
        Separate Timelines: Editing video and audio will be simplified with dedicated timelines, allowing for precise adjustments.
        Preview Window: Users can see their edits in real-time, ensuring they achieve the desired look and feel for their projects.
        Editing Tools: A variety of editing tools will be available, including play/pause controls, frame-by-frame editing, 
                       trimming, and the ability to take snapshots of key moments.
        Customizable Experience: Users will have the option to customize their workspace and toolbars, making the editing process 
                                 more efficient and tailored to individual preferences.

Development Progress

We are currently in the initial stages of development, focusing on setting up the project structure and creating the basic user 
interface. Our team is committed to continuous collaboration, ensuring that everyone’s ideas and feedback contribute to the project’s success.

Timeline: We aim to release a beta version of Mission Vardaan Studio within six months. This will allow users to test the application, 
provide feedback, and help us identify areas for improvement.

Conclusion:

Mission Vardaan Studio is not just about building a video editor; it's about creating a community of users who can share their experiences 
and help shape the software into a tool that meets their needs. We are excited about this journey and look forward to sharing our progress!
